				<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>1. 
				ACCEPTANCE AND CANCELLATION OF ORDERS</b><br>
				All orders are subject to acceptance by Electrodepot in writing 
				by a duly authorized agent of Electrodepot; any written 
				acknowledgement of receipt of an order shall not, in and of 
				itself, constitute such acceptance. Orders accepted by 
				Electrodepot may be cancelled by Customer upon written consent 
				of Electrodepot and provided such order is not &quot;NC/NR&quot; or 
				&quot;Non-Cancelable/Non-Returnable&quot; (&quot;Non-Standard Products&quot;) or 
				governed by a Purchase Agreement Letter. Non-Standard Products 
				are defined as Products which are special orders, custom orders, 
				orders for non-standard products, products not customarily in 
				stock or orders for value-added products. Non-standard products 
				are non-cancelable and non-refundable. In the event of 
				cancellation or other withdrawal in 30 days of an order for any reason and 
				without limiting any other remedy which Electrodepot may have as 
				a result of such cancellation or other withdrawal, reasonable 
				cancellation or restocking charges, which shall include all 
				expenses than incurred and commitments made by Electrodepot, 
				shall be paid by Customer to Electrodepot. Customer requests to 
				reschedule are subject to acceptance by Electrodepot in its sole 
				discretion. Orders may not be canceled or rescheduled after the 
				order has been submitted by Electrodepot to the shipment 
				carrier. Electrodepot reserves the right to allocate sales and 
				limit quantities of selected Products among its customers in its 
				sole discretion. Product specifications and availability are 
				subject to change without prior notice. </font></p>

				Returns</b><br>
				Customer must notify Electrodepot within 10 days from date of 
				shipment of any defective product. (See Electrodepot's LIMITED 
				WARRANTEE for further information.) Returns are normally 
				accepted when completed within 30 days of the ship date. If&nbsp; 
				Electrodepot agrees to accept a return, return freight charges 
				must be prepaid by customer. We will not accept COD shipments. 
				Some products may require that they be returned directly to the 
				manufacturer. Contact a sales representative for a return 
				authorization number and addressing instructions prior to 
				returning product. The forgoing statements concerning Returns do 
				not apply to SPECIAL ORDERS, NON-CANCELABLE/NON-RETURNABLE PRODUCTS. (See the 
				NON-CANCELABLE/NON-RETURNABLE PRODUCTS section in these terms.)

				Orders are billed at the prices (in US dollars) in effect at the 
				time of shipment. Prices will be as specified by Electrodepot

				Customer does not purchase the quantity upon which quantity 
				prices are based, Customer will pay the non-discounted price for

				<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>3. TERMS 
				OF PAYMENT</b><br>
				All payments must be in US Dollars. </font></p>
				<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 9pt"><u>For 
				Domestic Orders</u><br>
				Credit cards accepted are major credit cards, purchase cards and 
				major bank debit cards. Payment&nbsp; 100% Prepaid.<br>
				Net thirty (30) days is 
				available to Governments, schools and agencies or as 
				otherwise specified by Electrodepot. </font></p>
				<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 9pt"><u>For 
				International Orders</u><br>
				Credit Card billing information must be verified on new 
				customers prior to shipping the order.&nbsp; Outside of North 
				America there is a $10 banking fee charged on orders less than 
				$200. Prepaid Wire Transfer: You can wire the funds to our bank 
				listed at the beginning of the Terms and Conditions. We will 
				contact you with the total amount which will include shipping 
				charges and a $70 wire transfer fee. We will reserve stock for 
				your order for 48 hours on orders awaiting funds. Orders will be 
				canceled after 20 business days if funds have not been received. 
				Customer is responsible for duties and taxes. </font></p>
				<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>3.1 
				TERMS OF PAYMENT</b><br>
				<u>For All Orders</u><br>
				Customer agrees to pay the entire net amount of each invoice 
				from Electrodepot pursuant to the terms of each such invoice 
				without offset or deduction. Orders are subject to credit 
				approval by Electrodepot, which may in its sole discretion at 
				any time change the terms of Customer's credit, require payment 
				in cash, bank wire transfer or by official bank check and/or 
				require payment of any or all amounts due or to become due for 
				Customer's order before shipment of any or all of the Products. 
				If Electrodepot reasonably believes that the Customer's ability 
				to make payments may be impaired or if Customer fails to pay any 
				invoice when due, Electrodepot may suspend delivery of any order 
				or any remaining balance thereof until such payment is made or 
				cancel any order or any remaining balance thereof, and Customer 
				will remain liable to pay for any Products already shipped and 
				all Non-Standard Products ordered by Customer. Customer agrees 
				to submit such financial information as Electrodepot may 
				reasonably require for determination of credit terms and/or 
				continuation of credit terms. Checks are accepted subject to 
				collection and the date of collection will be deemed the date of 
				payment. Any check received from Customer may be applied by 
				Electrodepot against any obligation owing by Customer to 
				Electrodepot under this or any other contract, regardless of any 
				statement appearing on or referring to such check, without 
				discharging Customer's liability for any additional amounts 
				owing by Customer to Electrodepot. The acceptance by 
				Electrodepot of such check will not constitute a waiver of 
				Electrodepot's right to pursue the collection of any remaining 
				balance. Invoices not paid when due will bear interest to date 
				of payment at the annual rate of twenty four (24%) percent or 
				such lower rate as may be the maximum permitted by law. If 
				Customer fails to make payment when due, Electrodepot may pursue 
				any legal or equitable remedies, in which event Electrodepot 
				will be entitled to reimbursement for costs of collection and 
				reasonable attorneys' fees. There is a $25.00 service charge on 
				all returned checks. </font></p>
				<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>4. SALES 
				TAX</b><br>
				When required by law Electrodepot will collect Federal, State 
				and/or Local sale, use, excise and other taxes which apply to a 
				Customer's shipment. These taxes are in addition to the purchase 
				price of the Products subject to an order. Customer will remit 
				the correct tax unless they are tax exempt and Electrodepot has 
				a valid signed tax exemption certificate on file. </font></p>
				<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>5. 
				DELIVERY AND TITLE</b><br>
				All shipments by Electrodepot are F.O.B. point of shipment from 
				Electrodepot's facility and the amount of all transportation 
				charges will be paid to Electrodepot by the Customer in addition 
				to the purchase price of the Products. Subject to Electrodepot's 
				right of stoppage in transit, delivery of the Products to the 
				carrier will constitute delivery to Customer and title and risk 
				of loss will pass to Customer. Electrodepot will make reasonable 
				efforts to initiate shipment and schedule delivery as close as 
				possible to Customer's requested delivery date(s). Customer 
				acknowledges that delivery dates provided by Electrodepot are 
				estimates only and that Electrodepot will not be liable for 
				failure to deliver on such dates. Selection of the carrier and 
				delivery route will be made by Electrodepot unless specifically 
				designated by Customer. Electrodepot reserves the right to make 
				deliveries in installments. Delay in delivery of one installment 
				will not entitle Customer to cancel any other installment(s). 
				International deliveries or special orders can not be canceled. Delivery of any installment of Products within thirty (30) days 
				after the date requested will constitute a timely delivery. 
				Delivery of a quantity which varies from the quantity specified 
				shall not relieve Customer of the obligation to accept delivery 
				and pay for the Products delivered. </font></p>
